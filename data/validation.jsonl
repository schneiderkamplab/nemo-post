Sometimes it's by zombies, sometimes by the police, sometimes by communists (my grandpa would make me watch Red Dawn over and over as a child). Usually it will start outdoors, and I'll be hiding behind trees, racing across rickety bridges, and leaping ditches. Eventually it always ends up in a large old house with many staircases and closets. Often the hallways will narrow to tiny doors that no human can fit through. In my dream I must navigate the house, hiding from my pursuers. I've always been curious why I have this dream over and over.", "role": "assistant"}]}

However, Pianos have more \u201caction\u201d than keyboards (i.e. how the keys feel when pushed down, whether they are light or heavy).  So learning on a keyboard may not prepare a person for the heavier feeling of piano keys. If a piano is too costly or large, another option is learning on a keyboard with weighted keys that feel much more similar to a piano.", "role": "assistant"}]}

Most of these children are born to parents who migrated to the USA to work in fields such as Information Technology, Research or white collar jobs that require a good academic qualification. In general, for people to migrate from India to the US one of the main criteria is exceptional academic performance with post graduate university qualifications in addition to being very proficient in English.So, the parents of these children of Indian origin have a strong academic educational background and try to create an environment at home that places great emphasis on academic learning.\n\nSpellBee has become very popular with the events being telecast on TV. The event is becoming more popular among the Indian community in the US as they see Indian kids being successful in the contests and getting national recognition when they perform well in SpellBee. When the Indian parents find that their kids are showing some aptitude in spelling and are capable of putting in the required effort, the parents start motivating the children to start practising for SpellBee contests. \n\nThese children of Indian origin spend significant effort over a period of several months or in some cases even years fine tuning their skills to practise for SpellBee contests. A combination of hard work, the support from the parents and family and the motivation of these children to perform well in SpellBee are all factors contributing to the success of the children of Indian origin in the SpellBee contests in the USA.", "role": "assistant"}]}
