During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose. In more complex positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive.[citation needed] Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems.\n\nThe outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century. Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn.

He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered the development of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.\n\nBrowning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt\u2013Browning Model 1895 machine gun \u2013 a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.\n\nBrowning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 \u2013 the first semi-automatic shotgun.

Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration's primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.\n\nAmong the nation's Founding Fathers, Jefferson is considered unmatched in his intellectual depth and breadth. His passionate writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, were a leading inspiration behind the American Revolution, which ultimately gave rise to the American Revolutionary War, American independence, and the United States Constitution. Jefferson's ideas were globally influential in shaping and inspiring the Age of Enlightenment, which proved transformational in the late 17th and 18th centuries. He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. As a Virginia legislator, he drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nJefferson and Federalist John Adams became friends as well as political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796 presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which according to electoral procedure at the time, made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged Adams again in 1800 and won the presidency. After his term in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they shared a correspondence that lasted 14 years. He and Adams both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, which was also the 50th anniversary of Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation's claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.\n\nJefferson was a plantation owner, lawyer, and politician, and mastered many disciplines including surveying, mathematics, horticulture, and mechanics. He was also an architect in the Palladian tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his appointment as president of the American Philosophical Society. He largely shunned organized religion but was influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism, and deism. Jefferson rejected fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor of Caroline, and James Madison. In 1785, Jefferson authored Notes on the State of Virginia, considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800. Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment.\n\nSince the 1790s, Jefferson was rumored to have had children by his sister-in-law and slave Sally Hemings, leading to what is known as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. A 1998 DNA test concluded that one of Sally Hemings's children, Eston Hemings, was of the Jefferson male line. According to scholarly consensus, based on documentary and statistical evaluation, as well as oral history, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood.\n\nAfter retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France without war or controversy, and his ambitious and successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some modern historians are critical of Jefferson's personal involvement with slavery. Jefferson is consistently ranked among the top ten presidents of American history.", "role": "assistant"}]}

It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, John Locke, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. This movement is influenced by the scientific revolution in southern Europe arising directly from the Italian renaissance with people like Galileo Galilei. Over time it came to mean the Si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res, in English the Age of Enlightenment.[Note 1]\n\nMembers of the movement saw themselves as a progressive \u00e9lite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.\n\nThis intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumi\u00e8res movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of \"enlightenment\" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.\n\nIn the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy.", "role": "assistant"}]}

At that time, an estimated four million African Americans were set free.\n\nSupport for reparations\nWithin the political sphere, a bill demanding slavery reparations has been proposed at the national level, the \"Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act,\" which former Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-MI) reintroduced to the United States Congress every year from 1989 until his resignation in 2017. As its name suggests, the bill recommended the creation of a commission to study the \"impact of slavery on the social, political and economic life of our nation\"., however there are cities and institutions which have initiated reparations in the US (see \u00a7 Legislation and other actions for a list).\n\nIn 1999, African-American lawyer and activist Randall Robinson, founder of the TransAfrica advocacy organization, wrote that America's history of race riots, lynching, and institutional discrimination have \"resulted in $1.4 trillion in losses for African Americans\". Economist Robert Browne stated the ultimate goal of reparations should be to \"restore the black community to the economic position it would have if it had not been subjected to slavery and discrimination\". He estimates a fair reparation value anywhere between $1.4 to $4.7 trillion, or roughly $142,000 (equivalent to $162,000 in 2021) for every black American living today. Other estimates range from $5.7 to $14.2 and $17.1 trillion.\n\nIn 2014, American journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates published an article titled \"The Case for Reparations\", which discussed the continued effects of slavery and Jim Crow laws and made renewed demands for reparations. Coates refers to Rep. John Conyers Jr.'s H.R.40 Bill, pointing out that Congress's failure to pass this bill expresses a lack of willingness to right their past wrongs.\n\nIn September 2016, the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent encouraged Congress to pass H.R.40 to study reparations proposals. Still, the Working Group did not directly endorse any specific reparations proposal. The report noted that there exists a legacy of racial inequality in the United States, explaining that \"Despite substantial changes since the end of the enforcement of Jim Crow and the fight for civil rights, ideology ensuring the domination of one group over another, continues to negatively impact the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today.\" The report notes that a \"dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion among the US population\".\n\nThe topic of reparations gained renewed attention in 2020 as the Black Lives Matter movement named reparations as one of their policy goals in the United States.\n\nIn 2020, rapper T.I. supported reparations that would give every African American US$1 million and asserted that slavery caused mass incarcerations, poverty, and other ills.\n\nUsing examples taken from the text give me a summary of the main arguments in favour of slavery reparations in the United States and the anticipated cost of enacting such reparations", "role": "user"}, {"content": "In spite of progressive changes since the end of enforcement of Jim Crow and the successes of the fight for civil rights there are still inherent racial inequalities in the USA which negatively affect the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today.

{"messages": [{"content": "Give me five ways in which I can make my homebrew beer more interesting", "role": "user"}, {"content": "There are infinite ways to create interesting flavours, that are either personal favourites or attempt to replicate classic beers and beer styles. There are a number of factors that make up a beers flavour profile and part of the enjoyment brewing your own beer at home, is that you can play around with each of these to change the flavour and character of your homebrew beer. Here are five ways in which you can change your own homebrew recipe to add interesting flavours or alternatively you can alter an existing homebrew recipe shared by somebody else or a brewery.\n\n1. Use different hops\nThere is a huge variety of hops available to homebrewers and each of these can introduce its own particular flavour and aroma to your beer, ranging from pineapple and apricots, to pine trees and woods, to grapefruit pith and lemon zest. By using a different hop in your recipe either from the same family or from an entirely different family of hops, you can easily add interesting and often radical changes to the flavour profile of your beer. However, depending on when the hops are added in the brewing process, you can also increase/decrease the levels of bitterness of your beer, due to different hop varieties having different levels of alpha acids.\n\n2. Use a different yeast\nBesides fermenting the beer, yeast leave behind lots of interesting flavours and can give your homebrew it's own subtle character. For example, English yeast strains can add malty and sweet flavours, California yeast tends to create a clean and crisp beer, whilst saison yeast adds bright and fruity flavours to your beer.\n\n3. Use different grains\nChanging the amount of base malts can increase or decrease the alcohol in your finished beer. Trying swapping one base malt for another, like American pale malts for a British variety, and look for the subtle differences between them. You can also play around with the specialty grains, like using a slightly darker roast.\n\n4. Add fruit, spices or herbs\nFruits, spices, herbs, and other ingredients are a great way to add an entirely personal character to your homebrew. Anything from fresh strawberries and basil to vanilla beans and cardamom can really complement the other malty, hoppy flavours in a beer. \n\n5. Alter your water profile\nDifferent beer styles will typically be best achieved with a suitable water profile, with different levels of minerals to achieve the desired flavour profile. By adjusting the amounts of specific minerals found in your brewing water, beer can be made to taste fuller bodied, sweeter, drier, more bitter, or even sour.", "role": "assistant"}]}

Performances by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the Bell labs in New Jersey. Some multitrack recordings were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by MGM (as early as 1937) and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (as early as 1941). RCA Victor began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, Avery Fisher, an amateur violinist, began experimenting with audio design and acoustics. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra\u2014that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound. After World War II, Harry F. Olson conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high-fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.[citation needed]\n\nBeginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made major improvements of home-audio quality possible:\n\nReel-to-reel audio tape recording, based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as Bing Crosby make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.\nThe advent of the 33\u2153 rpm Long Play (LP) microgroove vinyl record, with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified equalization curves as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. Classical music fans, who were opinion leaders in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.\nHigher quality turntables, with more responsive needles\nFM radio, with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than AM radio.\nBetter amplifier designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible distortion.\nNew loudspeaker designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by Edgar Villchur and Henry Kloss with improved bass frequency response.\nIn the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase high fidelity as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. Many consumers found the difference in quality compared to the then-standard AM radios and 78-rpm records readily apparent and bought high-fidelity phonographs and 33\u2153 LPs such as RCA's New Orthophonics and London's FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK Decca system). Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, preamplifiers, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. With the advent of integrated multi-speaker console systems in the 1950s, hi-fi became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing phonograph and record player.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of stereophonic equipment and recordings led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance stereo displaced hi-fi. Records were now played on a stereo. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of high fidelity continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the \"Golden Age of Hi-Fi\", when vacuum tube equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered superior by modern audiophiles, and just before solid state (transistorized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.\n\nIn the 1960s, the FTC with the help of the audio manufacturers came up with a definition to identify high fidelity equipment so that the manufacturers could clearly state if they meet the requirements and reduce misleading advertisements.\n\nThe metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was adapted into a power MOSFET for audio by Jun-ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University in 1974. Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by Yamaha for their hi-fi audio amplifiers. JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974. In 1977, Hitachi introduced the LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics (V-series) and Ashly Audio, and were used for music and public address systems. Class-D amplifiers became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available. Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their power sections, because their distortion curve is more tube-like.\n\nA popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated music centre\u2014which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction.\n\nAudiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers, and other components.\n\nListening tests\nSee also: Codec listening test\nListening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines, and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid-state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which listeners cannot see the components being tested. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and sample B, an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent, a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is not transparent.\n\nBlind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these blind tests is not accepted by some audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound in their evaluations of audio equipment. John Atkinson, current editor of Stereophile, stated that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that \"the magic was gone\" until he replaced it with a tube amp. Robert Harley of The Absolute Sound wrote, in 2008, that: \"...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon.\"\n\nDoug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009. He stated: \"Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so.\" Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB, and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers.

Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.\n\nWhat is SVM?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "SVM stands for \"\"support vector machine\".

{"messages": [{"content": "The law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that people within an organization commonly or typically give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. Parkinson provides the example of a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bicycle shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.\n\nThe law has been applied to software development and other activities. The terms bicycle-shed effect, bike-shed effect, and bike-shedding were coined based on Parkinson's example; it was popularised in the Berkeley Software Distribution community by the Danish software developer Poul-Henning Kamp in 1999 and, due to that, has since become popular within the field of software development generally.\n\nArgument\n\nA bicycle shed\nThe concept was first presented as a corollary of his broader \"Parkinson's law\" spoof of management. He dramatizes this \"law of triviality\" with the example of a committee's deliberations on an atomic reactor, contrasting it to deliberations on a bicycle shed. As he put it: \"The time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum [of money] involved.\" A reactor is so vastly expensive and complicated that an average person cannot understand it (see ambiguity aversion), so one assumes that those who work on it understand it. However, everyone can visualize a cheap, simple bicycle shed, so planning one can result in endless discussions because everyone involved wants to implement their own proposal and demonstrate personal contribution.\n\nAfter a suggestion of building something new for the community, like a bike shed, problems arise when everyone involved argues about the details. This is a metaphor indicating that it is not necessary to argue about every little feature based simply on having the knowledge to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.\n\nThe law of triviality is supported by behavioural research. People tend to spend more time on small decisions than they should, and less time on big decisions than they should. A simple explanation is that during the process of making a decision, one has to assess whether enough information has been collected to make the decision. If people make mistakes about whether they have enough information, they will tend to stop too early for big decisions. The reason is that big decisions require collecting information for a long time. It leaves more time to make a mistake (and stop) before getting enough information. Conversely, for small decisions, where people should stop early, they may continue to ponder for too long by mistake.\n\nRelated principles and formulations \nThere are several other principles, well-known in specific problem domains, which express a similar sentiment.\n\nWadler's law, named for computer scientist Philip Wadler, is a principle which asserts that the bulk of discussion on programming-language design centers on syntax (which, for purposes of the argument, is considered a solved problem), as opposed to semantics.\n\nSayre's law is a more general principle, which holds (among other formulations) that \"In any dispute, the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake\"; many formulations of the principle focus on academia.\n\nWho coined the phrase \"Bike-shedding\" and when?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The phrase \"bike-shedding\" was introduced in 1957 by C.

She is often shown in the midst of her war with Mahishasura, the buffalo demon, at the time she victoriously kills the demonic force. Her icon shows her in action, yet her face is calm and serene. In Hindu arts, this tranquil attribute of Durga's face is traditionally derived from the belief that she is protective and violent not because of her hatred, egotism or getting pleasure in violence, but because she acts out of necessity, for the love of the good, for liberation of those who depend on her, and a mark of the beginning of soul's journey to creative freedom.\n\nDurga traditionally holds the weapons of various male gods of Hindu mythology, which they give her to fight the evil forces because they feel that she is shakti (energy, power). These include the chakra, conch, bow, arrow, sword, javelin, trishula, shield, and a noose. These weapons are considered symbolic by Shakta Hindus, representing self-discipline, selfless service to others, self-examination, prayer, devotion, remembering her mantras, cheerfulness and meditation. Durga herself is viewed as the \"Self\" within and the divine mother of all creation. She has been revered by warriors, blessing their new weapons.

{"messages": [{"content": "As a golfer, how can I fix my slice?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "A common swing fault in golfers is a slice which is caused when the face of the club isn't aligned properly to the swing path of the club.  What will typically happen is at the time of impact, the face is open in relation to the target (ie aimed to the right if you are a right handed golfer) and the swing path is closed in relation to the target (ie aimed to the left if you are a left handed golfer).  When there is a large difference between the path of the swing and the face of the club, the impact will generate a high degree of lateral spin on the ball causing the flight of the ball to curve away from the target.  Here are some ways to fix this swing fault:\n\n1. Grip the club with a stronger grip.  This means the v formed between your thumb and pointer finger on back hand is pointed to your rear shoulder and your opposite hand it also gripping the club more from the back.  This will help you close the face of the club at impact.\n2. Focus on keeping the face closed in the backswing.  One fault many amateurs have is the club face opens toward the sky on the backswing too far meaning that the face will need to turn more on the downswing to get to square at impact.  Creating less rotation on the backswing can help with this.  \n3. Keeping hips down and back in the downswing.  One fault that can cause inconsistent contact as well as a slice is when the hips thrust forward during the downswing causing the golfer to lift up to counter being too close to the ball which can often cause an over the top, out-to-in swing path.  Try to keep the hips back through the swing and focus on rotating the body to keep forward or lateral movement to a minimum.  \n\nA slice is a very common issue among golfers but knowing the causes and swing faults that lead to a slice can help you think about how you can improve your swing to fix it.", "role": "assistant"}]}

While many other countries may put safety first, the harsh reality for Americans is that freedom always comes before safety. Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.\nThe 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.\nOften a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?\nOn the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.\nTo be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure.

Provide an example of how these APIs might work.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "As a kid, I loved watching the Jetsons. As I grew older and ended up writing software and creating & implementing architectures for systems, I thought I would never see the day when a Jetsons-like kitchen would be feasible.\nGPT (ChatGPT, etc.) has changed my mind.\n\nContractual Obligations\nAs an architect, you kind of need to think like a lawyer. You define contracts (APIs) between systems or components. You monitor those APIs for abuse or misuse.\n\nI would use Swagger editor to define those contracts, and I would write the APIs to match interactions implied in mock-ups. I would vet the design with the team, I would walk through scenarios to see if the API would fit the use case and would not introduce performance bottlenecks, and I would simulate and automate as much as I could along the journey.\n\nI was very careful to get it right the first time. It was never perfect the first time, of course. So, I also had to consider how the API could evolve while minimizing costs/impact to the rest of the system. The API, once deployed, would become something I would guard, like an honest politician guards the #usconstitution. The team had to be careful with any change that impacted the API.\n\nAPI Mesh... More like API mess!\nAPIs rely on APIs which rely on more APIs and libraries. Once a system gets large enough, that complexity becomes a bottleneck. Small changes can have a huge ripple effect. Some approaches (like federated #GraphQL) help manage this complexity nicely. But it still involves an API under which there can exist a lot of fragility. #Agile or not, developing a complicated web of APIs is complex, requires specialized skills, and is full of unforeseen challenges.\n\nThe Kitchen Conversation, ChatGPT-style\nThe Jetsons' kitchen involves a number of systems, each composed of various parts, sensors, hardware, inputs and outputs. Considering the complexity of interactions between independent systems in a kitchen, the fact that the Jetsons' kitchen components would come from various vendors or manufacturers, traditional API design would not be able to fulfill the vision. Not practical, at all.\n\nNow, let's think about APIs and the Jetsons' kitchen, #chatgpt -style.\n\nLet's keep it simple: pizza. You (or your robot) make a pizza from scratch.\n\nThe oven asks the refrigerator: \"I see we have a pizza. Can you tell me if this is low-moisture mozzarella?\"\n\nRefrigerator: \"That's not even mozzarella. This pizza must have Muenster cheese as that is all I had in me. And the human removed some of the contents 30 minutes ago, so the probability of Muenster cheese on that pizza is quite high.\"\n\nA sensor from the kitchen who has eyes across the room chimes in at this point. Sensor: \"Beware that the crust of this pizza is made of cauliflower. I agree with the video sensor's assessment regarding the type of cheese. No new cheese entered the kitchen recently.\"\n\nOven: \"Anything else I should know?\"\n\nSensor: \"The temperature of the dough is 47F. This is cooler than the expert chef consensus of using room-temperature dough.\"\n\nOven: \"Great. I know what to do. Since the dough is cool, I will start cooking with a temperature a little lower than the recipe specifies. Then I will increase the temp of bottom element so as to provide a nice crisp crust. I will keep a close eye on moisture and may use convection to mitigate any undesirable levels of moisture.\"\n\nWhere is the API that contractually binds the independent systems? APIs are not gone. For instance, the brain of the Oven will have myriad APIs (e.g. for interacting with temperature controllers and sensors, etc.). The key here is that the interface between systems is no longer a fixed, rigid API. No method signatures, no paths, no payload specifications. Instead, a conversation relating to senses and capabilities.\n\nWhat \"brain\"?\nKence Anderson's book Designing Autonomous AI describes nicely how a complex system can be decomposed into a number of independent \"brains.\" Each brain, in his book, can be independently developed and refined, with human guidance married with #datascience, #machinelearning and #dataengineering.\n\nWhat's Cookin'?\nI am excited for what the future holds. How architects rethink complex system design with regards to APIs is, in my opinion, something that is inevitable. And, as an amateur pizza maker, my taste buds are watering for the day I get some GPT help to make an even better #detroitpizza.", "role": "assistant"}]}

Australia, the nearest test playing country to New Zealand, refused to grant Test status to any games played between the two nations until well after World War 2. This lack of test opportunities led to a now common path of talented New Zealanders moving off shore for the chance to play test cricket- most notably in the pre WWII period of Clarrie Grimmet, who took over 200 test wickets playing for Australia. Since then, Andrew Caddick (234 test wickets at an average of 29.91) and Ben Stokes (5000+ test runs and 196 test wickets) have played leading roles for England in tests.\n\nIf however we define the question as \"the best test cricket player to have played for New Zealand\", then there are perhaps only 3 or 4 candidates that feature. Of the current generation, there is no doubt that Kane Williamson will one day be regarded as the greatest player to have come from New Zealand- with over 8000 test runs at an average north of 50. With many years in front of him, Williamson will no doubt hold the crown of best test cricketer in years to come. \n\nMartin Crowe must likewise be regarded in the pantheon of test greats to have played for New Zealand- despite a slow start to his career, and injuries curtailing his time in the team, he amassed over 5000 runs at an average of over 45.\n\nHowever, most will agree that the most influential cricketer ever to play test cricket for New Zealand was Sir Richard Hadlee- the first cricketer to be knighted whilst still playing cricket for his country. Hadlee's bowling average of 22.29 is one of best in test cricket history, and at the time of his retirement he held the record for test wickets, at 431. Gaining 5 wickets in an innings 36 times was also a record, and led New Zealand to some of it's most famous test victories, notably victory in a series in Australia for the first time in 1985/86, with his best test figures of 15 for 123 coming in the first test at the Gabba. Added to his bowling, his destructive lower order batting made his one of the preeminent all rounders of the game., and truly NZ's best test cricketer.", "role": "assistant"}]}

Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\nIndigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nCanada is a parliamentary liberal democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, and education.

Since 2015, it has been known as The Emirates FA Cup after its headline sponsor. A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970.\n\nThe competition is open to all eligible clubs down to Level 9 of the English football league system with Level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above. Included in the competition are 20 professional clubs in the Premier League (level 1), 72 professional clubs in the English Football League (levels 2 to 4), and all clubs in steps 1\u20135 of the National League System (levels 5 to 9) as well as a tiny number of step 6 clubs acting as stand-ins for non-entries above. A record 763 clubs competed in 2011\u201312. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds \u2013 the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen.\n\nThe first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper. In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final. As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory.\n\nWinners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is the most successful manager in the history of the competition, having won seven finals as Arsenal's manager.\n\nLiverpool are the current holders, having beaten Chelsea 6\u20135 on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw in the 2022 final.", "role": "assistant"}]}

Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name \"GNU/Linux\" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.\n\nWhat is Linux?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.\n\nIn 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.\n\nOnyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.\n\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system. As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.\n\nIn 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System. This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.\n\nIn 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.\n\nThese factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own.", "role": "assistant"}]}

Lincoln led the Union through the American Civil War to defend the nation as a constitutional union and succeeded in abolishing slavery, bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.\n\nLincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. Congressman from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in central Illinois. In 1854, he was angered by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, and he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began seceding from the nation. During this time, the newly formed Confederate States of America began seizing federal military bases in the south. Just over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, the Confederate States attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South Carolina.

{"messages": [{"content": "Can I make chocolate at home?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Making chocolate at home can be rewarding, but be prepared to spend a little money and a lot of time. The money goes to equipment and cocoa beans. For equipment, you will need a melanger (about $600)  to grind the beans and a tempering machine (about $400) to make the finished product. You will also need a silicone mat (about $20) and a hair dryer (about $30). But let's start at the beginning.\n\nBuy between two and six pounds of fermented raw cocoa beans. There are a variety of retail importers you can find on the web. Choose a single variety or a blend that appeals to your taste in chocolate.\n\nSort the beans, removing broken beans, badly misshapen beans, and whatever foreign bodies may be present.\n\nRoast the beans, two pounds at a time, at 350F for between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your experience with the beans or by how they smell. They will smell like fresh brownies. Don't scorch them!\n\nLet the beans cool.\n\nPeel the beans. You can do this by hand - which I find produces a superior product - but be warned that this can take up to 6 hours per pound. Alternatively, you can purchase a winnower and use the hair dryer to blow out the skins. This approach is much faster, but leaves more skin and loses more bean fragments. Either way, weigh your final bean yield.\n\nGet you melanger going. Use the hair dryer to get the grinding surfaces up to at least 120F. Add the beans a handful at a time. Help the melanger along if it gets stuck. Make sure the melanger is going steadily before leaving it unattended. When it gets going, it will flow well.\n\nRun the melanger for 24 to 72 hours, again depending on your experience with the beans and your tastes. If trying a mix of beans, add the more robustly flavored beans early in the process and the more delicately flavored beans later. Give even the most delicate beans at least 8 hours. Add sugar to taste. The percentage of sugar by weight can vary from a few percent up to 30 percent. You may also add dried whole fat milk at this point, and other flavorings, like an inch or so of vanilla bean. Melange the sugar and other additives at least 8 more hours. The goal is to decrease the particle size below what can be detected by the  tongue. When done, decant into a silicone mat line baking pan. This is your untempered chocolate. it melts easily and tends to get crumbly as it ages. Which is why you will want to temper it.\n\nFinally, follow the directions on your tempering machine, adding chunks of untempered chocolate as indicated. The liquid tempered chocolate can be used for fruit dipping or can be poured into molds for bars or shaped candies. Other additives can be included at this stage - nuts, nougat etc. Cool the results at room temperature for several hours before serving. Enjoy the results of your labor.", "role": "assistant"}]}

The park caters to high-paying guests who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans.

Westworld's first season is the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. The first season also received critical acclaim and was highly praised for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes and soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi. Reception of the series declined from the second season onwards, with the scripts, characterization and narrative opacity being targeted for criticism; viewership ratings also diminished throughout its run.

Valdivia, Chile 22 May 1960 (magnitude 9.5)\nThis earthquake killed 1655 people, injured 3000 and displaced two million. It caused US$550 million damage in Chile, while the tsunami that it spawned caused deaths and damage as far away as Hawaii, Japan and the Philippines. The 'rupture zone' of the quake was more than 1000 km long. Two days after the initial quake, the nearby volcano Puyehue erupted, sending ash and steam up to 6 km into the atmosphere over a period of several weeks.\n\n2. Prince William Sound, Alaska 28 March 1964 (magnitude 9.2)\nCompared to the Chilean earthquake, this earthquake was less damaging: the resulting tsunami took 128 lives and caused overall US$311 million in damage. The earthquake was felt mainly over Alaska, as well as some places in Canada, while the tsunami created by it caused damage as far away as Hawaii. The most damage was sustained by the city of Anchorage, 120 km north-west of the epicentre. Shaking from the quake itself is reported to have lasted for three minutes.\n\n3. Sumatra, Indonesia 26 December 2004 (magnitude 9.1)\nIn terms of damage and loss of life, the scale of the disaster caused by the resulting Boxing Day Tsunami was enormous. In total, 227,900 people were killed or presumed dead, with around 1.7 million displaced over 14 countries in South Asia and East Africa. The epicentre was 250 km south-east of Band Aceh, Indonesia, at a depth of 30 km. Several days later on 28 December, a mud volcano began erupting near Baratang, Andamar Islands, which is thought to have been associated with the earthquake.\n\n4. Sendai, Japan 11 March 2011 (magnitude 9.0)\nSo far the official death toll stands at several thousand from the combined effect of the powerful earthquake, aftershocks and the tsunami. However, the total is expected to rise, with some estimates of a final toll of over 10,000. Economic impacts are expected to be huge, with the shutting down of nuclear reactors which many industries rely on for power.\n\n5. Kamchatka, Russia 4 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0)\nThis earthquake generated a tsunami that caused widespread damage in the Hawaiian Islands. Property damage was estimated at around US$1,000,000. Some reports describe waves of over 9 m high at Kaena Point, Oahu. A farmer on Oahu reported the loss of six cows to the tsunami, but no people were reported killed.\n\n6. Bio-bio, Chile 27 February 2010 (magnitude 8.8)\nThis earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed at least 521 people, with 56 missing and 12,000 injured. More than 800,000 people were displaced with a total of 1.8m people affected across Chile, where damage was estimated at US$30 billion. The epicentre was 335 km south-west of Santiago, at a depth of 35 km. A minor tsunami travelled across the Pacific causing damage to boats as far away as San Diego, California.\n\n7. Off the coast of Ecuador 31 January 1906 (magnitude 8.8)\nThis earthquake caused a tsunami that is reported to have killed between 500 and 1,500 in Ecuador and Colombia. The tsunami travelled as far north as San Francisco, on the west coast of the US, and west to Hawaii and Japan. The tsunami took roughly 12 hours to cross the Pacific to Hilo, Hawaii.\n\n8. Rat Islands, Alaska 2 April 1965 (magnitude 8.7)\nThe worst of the damage attributed to this earthquake was caused by a tsunami, reported to be about 10 m high on Shemya Island. The wave caused flooding on Amchitka Island, causing US$10,000 in property damage. No deaths or injuries were reported.\n\n9. Sumatra, Indonesia 28 March 2005 (magnitude 8.6)\nThis earthquake killed 1313, with over 400 people injured by the tsunami as far away as Sri Lanka. The epicentre was 205 km north-west of Sibolga, Sumatra, at a depth of 30 km. This region, also the site of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, is particularly geologically active, with three of the 15 biggest known earthquakes having happened here.\n\n10. Assam - Tibet 15 August 1950 (magnitude 8.6)\nThis inland earthquake caused widespread damages to buildings as well as large landslides. 780 people were killed in eastern Tibet, with many villages and towns affected across Assam, China, Tibet and India. Oscillations to lake levels occurred as far away as Norway. The total death toll is likely to be higher, as no definitive total was ever estimated.

Specialized capabilities may include equipment or natural resources as well as skills. Training and combinations of equipment and other assets acting together are often important. For example, an individual may specialize by acquiring tools and the skills to use them effectively just as an organization may specialize by acquiring specialized equipment and hiring or training skilled operators. The division of labour is the motive for trade and the source of economic interdependence.\n\nHistorically, an increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total output and trade, the rise of capitalism, and the increasing complexity of industrialized processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient Sumerian (Mesopotamian) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.\n\nAfter the Neolithic Revolution, pastoralism and agriculture led to more reliable and abundant food supplies, which increased the population and led to specialization of labour, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites. This specialization was furthered by the process of industrialization, and Industrial Revolution-era factories. Accordingly, many classical economists as well as some mechanical engineers, such as Charles Babbage, were proponents of division of labour.

NPCI set out with a mandate to change the face of India\u2019s payment systems. It developed the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as an architecture framework with a set of standard Application Programming Interface (API) specifications to facilitate online payments. The aim was to simplify and provide a single interface across all NPCI systems, thereby creating interoperability and a superior customer experience.\n\nUPI is now one of the most preferred payment solutions in India, with over a billion transactions every month. FY22, the total transaction value processed by the United Payments Interface (UPI) platform accounted for 86% of India\u2019s GDP. UPI\u2019s core function is to support easy and secure money transfers between bank accounts. It does this by adding multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, allowing for seamless fund transfers and merchant payments from one place. It also enables \u2018peer to peer\u2019 and \u2018peer to merchant\u2019 collection requests, which can be scheduled and paid as requested.\n\nPayments can be made using a UPI ID, UPI Number, Account number, and an Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). Payment security is as per applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines using a 1-click 2-factor authentication where the second factor of authentication is the UPI PIN. \n\nUPI can be accessed on all major platforms such as Android and iOS with apps developed by members for versions of Android 4.2.2 and iOS 8.1 and above.\n\nThe primary business uses of UPI are to allow a personal mobile as the primary device for all payments, including person to person, person to entity, and entity to person. Using a personal mobile an individual can \u2018Pay\u2019 someone (push) as well as \u2018Collect\u2019 from\nsomeone (pull). In addition, the ability to pay and collect using \u2018UPI IDs\u2019 that are \u2018aliases\u2019 to the VPA. The goal is to make  payments by providing an address without having to ever provide account details or credentials on third party applications or websites.\nAlso, sending \u2018collect\u2019 requests to others (person to person or entity to person) with a\u2018pay by\u2019 date, which allows customers to pay at a later date without blocking the money in the account. UPI also allows for pre-authorizing multiple recurring payments (utilities, school fees, subscriptions, etc.) with a one-time secure authentication and rule-based access, similar to ECS. UPI autopay allows customers to set recurring payments for their UPI transactions. Recurring payments up to Indian Rupees 2000 can be set at the frequency desired.\n\nThis makes payments using UPI a fully interoperable system across all PSPs without having silos and closed systems with one-click two-factor authentication, using a personal\nphone, and without any acquiring devices or physical tokens.\n\nIn March 2023, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the linkage of UPI and Singapore\u2019s PayNow. Remittances from Singapore to India were on track to breach the $100 billion mark in 2023, making it the fourth highest remitting nation to India, accounting for 5.7% of all inbound remittances.

{"messages": [{"content": "Despite its theoretical importance, critics of MPT question whether it is an ideal investment tool, because its model of financial markets does not match the real world in many ways\n\nThe risk, return, and correlation measures used by MPT are based on\u00a0[expected values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value), which means that they are statistical statements about the future (the expected value of returns is explicit in the above equations, and implicit in the definitions of\u00a0[variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)\n\u00a0and\u00a0[covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance)). Such measures often cannot capture the true statistical features of the risk and return which often follow highly skewed distributions (e.g. the\u00a0[log-normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution)) and can give rise to, besides reduced\u00a0[volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)), also inflated growth of return.\u00a0In practice, investors must substitute predictions based on historical measurements of asset return and volatility for these values in the equations. Very often such expected values fail to take account of new circumstances that did not exist when the historical data were generated.\n\nMore fundamentally, investors are stuck with estimating key parameters from past market data because MPT attempts to model risk in terms of the likelihood of losses, but says nothing about why those losses might occur. The risk measurements used are\u00a0[probabilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability)\u00a0in nature, not structural.

Dependent communist governments were installed in the Eastern Bloc satellite states. After becoming the world's second nuclear power, the Soviet Union established the Warsaw Pact alliance, and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the Cold War, with the rivaling United States and NATO. After Stalin's death in 1953 and a short period of collective rule, the new leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and launched the policy of de-Stalinization, releasing many political prisoners from the Gulag labor camps. The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the Khrushchev Thaw. At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba.\n\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, thus starting the Space Age. Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the Vostok 1 manned spacecraft on 12 April 1961. Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of collective rule ensued, until Leonid Brezhnev became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the Era of Stagnation. The 1965 Kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralisation of the Soviet economy. In 1979, after a communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. In May 1988, the Soviets started to withdraw from Afghanistan, due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.\n\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.\n\nBy 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the Baltic states chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On 17 March, a referendum was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a renewed federation. In June 1991, Boris Yeltsin became the first directly elected president in Russian history when he was elected president of the Russian SFSR. In August 1991, a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none.\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest. African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008\u20132009, with South Africa having the world's highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7, although this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation.

Does there exist another shape?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Not all planets and moons are round. There is some variety in their shapes depending on their masses, and curiously looking worlds might even exist, unlike anything we know from our system.\n\nEverything within a planet or a moon is under the influence of gravity in such a way that bits of it would move to the center if they could. Under ideal conditions, it would acquire a spherical shape. For objects made of something other than liquids, it varies at what point they become round. It is generally assumed that they mostly become spheres around 400 kilometers/248 miles in diameter when made from icy material commonly found in our Solar System. Still, if something is made from something more rigid, it needs to be larger in diameter than that - around 750 km/466 miles. At a sufficient mass, even rock becomes fluid-like. The moon of Mars Deimos is only 12.6 km/7.8 miles across and is not spherical, and there are many other small moons of other planets that don\u2019t have a round shape.\n\nThis, however, is not all. Astronomical objects spin, giving them the flattened shape of a sphere the faster their rotation if they are massive enough. On top of it, they can have moons. This causes a bulge to form at the position of their orbiting body around them. In the case of Earth, our Moon causes tides via this process. Also, our Sun gives our planet tides. Elsewhere in the Universe, there could be planets with massive moons or two similarly massive planets, called double planets, orbiting their common center of mass, the barycenter, at a close distance, which can cause even stronger bulging. Their shape would be affected this way more visibly.\n\nFinally, a bizarre, toroidal planet, shown above, can be stable from what we know from physics, at least for a while. As I mentioned earlier, even rigid rock behaves like a fluid at large masses. An adequate rotation speed can counterbalance the strength of gravity with centrifugal acceleration, and a torus-shaped planet could exist. A possible scenario for such a world to come to be would be if two sufficiently fast rotating planets collided and formed a doughnut of vaporized rock, a so-called synestia.\n\nWe currently think that the events that would lead to the formation of a world of this shape are so unlikely that there might not be a single toroidal planet in the Visible Universe, but we were quite a few times surprised by what we discovered during our exploration of Cosmos. Perhaps we will even find a doughnut shape world one day.", "role": "assistant"}]}

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\n\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic.

He tells the story of Julia Angwin, a journalist whose ProPublica investigation of the COMPAS algorithm, a tool for predicting recidivism among criminal defendants, led to widespread criticism of its accuracy and bias towards certain demographics. One of AI's main alignment challenges is its black box nature (inputs and outputs are identifiable but the transformation process in between is undetermined). The lack of transparency makes it difficult to know where the system is going right and where it is going wrong.\n\nAgency\nIn the second section, Christian similarly interweaves the history of the psychological study of reward, such as behaviorism and dopamine, with the computer science of reinforcement learning, in which AI systems need to develop policy (\"what to do\") in the face of a value function (\"what rewards or punishment to expect\"). He calls the DeepMind AlphaGo and AlphaZero systems \"perhaps the single most impressive achievement in automated curriculum design.\" He also highlights the importance of curiosity, in which reinforcement learners are intrinsically motivated to explore their environment, rather than exclusively seeking the external reward.\n\nNormativity\nThe third section covers training AI through the imitation of human or machine behavior, as well as philosophical debates such as between possibilism and actualism that imply different ideal behavior for AI systems.

The Netherlands consists of twelve provinces; it borders Germany to the east, and Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline to the north and west. It shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium in the North Sea. The country's official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland. Dutch, English and Papiamento are official in the Caribbean territories.\n\nThe four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and the nominal capital. The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet and Supreme Court. The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest seaport in Europe. Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest in Europe. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD, and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. It hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are centred in The Hague.\n\nNetherlands literally means \"lower countries\" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with nearly 26% falling below sea level. Most of the areas below sea level, known as polders, are the result of land reclamation that began in the 14th century. In the Republican period, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, established colonies and trading posts all over the world.\n\nWith a population of 17.8 million people, all living within a total area of 41,850 km2 (16,160 sq mi)\u2014of which the land area is 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi)\u2014the Netherlands is the 16th most densely populated country in the world and the second-most densely populated country in the European Union, with a density of 531 people per square kilometre (1,380 people/sq mi). Nevertheless, it is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its fertile soil, mild climate, intensive agriculture, and inventiveness.\n\nThe Netherlands has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848. The country has a tradition of pillarisation and a long record of social tolerance, having legalised abortion, prostitution and euthanasia, along with maintaining a liberal drug policy. The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919 and was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001.

The situations in which we are raised have a considerable bearing on who we become in later life. But, it's not necessarily so black and white. There are countless examples of children having been born into extremely difficult circumstances, who have grown to be well rounded, high contributing members of society. \n\nAs a result, It would be reasonable to assume that Nature is a strong factor, regardless of the Nurture (the environment) in which a person is raised.

{"messages": [{"content": "Using llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then. Some would even use them to guard their smaller cousins, the alpaca. They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.\n\nResearch suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.\n\nUsing llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama.

Meanwhile generative AI capabilities such as Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are able to generate highly realistic and detailed images from text descriptions, demonstrating a level of creativity and imagination that was once thought to be exclusively human.\n\nHumans seem fundamentally wired to continuously advance technology and improve our knowledge and capabilities. Also, the human brain tends to think linearly, causing us to underestimate the exponential progress of technology. Companies and nations are incentivized by market forces and geopolitical game theory to pursue better intelligence through the advancement of AI.\n\nThe Future of Life Institute recently published Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter. The letter \u2014 with notable signatories including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Andrew Yang \u2014 caused a stir, calling for a 6 month pause on advanced AI development:\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.\u201d\n\nMuch of the media and public discourse in response to this letter has focused on who signed it and pushing back on the notion that humanity faces an imminent existential threat of artificial superintelligence. Dystopian claims of runaway artificial intelligence seem hyperbolic to many people, and calling for a 6 month moratorium is not realistic. Good luck convincing China to \u201cpause\u201d their efforts in the AI arms race.\n\nBut are there no boundaries? Should we proceed with no guidelines?\n\nFor example \u2026\n\nAre we comfortable outsourcing decisions to black box AI systems that lack transparency and explainability, making it impossible for humans to understand the reasoning behind decisions?\nShould we be worried about the development of AI-powered autonomous weapons that make decisions about the use of lethal force without human input?\nShould we be worried about the potential for malicious actors to use AI for nefarious purposes, such as sophisticated propaganda campaigns?\nAre our current laws, regulations and political systems equipped to handle the rapid influx of new AI alignment questions that society will grapple with in the very near future?\nAs AI becomes more advanced, it may become difficult to understand, which could lead to unintended outcomes. AI systems can behave in ways that are unforeseen and difficult to control. The AI alignment problem is a societal challenge that requires collaboration between researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and the public. It will also require international cooperation between governments and the private sector. This is not just a technical challenge, but also a philosophical and ethical one.\n\nThe open letter mentioned above goes on to recommend:\n\n\u201cAI research and development should be refocused on making today\u2019s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal.\u201d\n\nThis is certainly a worthy goal, and it can be achieved by doing AI in the open. What we currently lack is a framework. Society needs a set of procedures and protocols to make the recommendation from The Future of Life Institute actionable.\n\nJointly, we must consider and debate the pros and cons of many ideas, including but not limited to:\n\nMandatory disclosure of model details, including training datasets, evaluation methodologies, and known biases\nDevelopment of a framework that establishes model monitoring and audit requirements for advanced AI systems\nImplementation of laws that impose liability for AI-caused harm\nEstablishment of a regulatory authority for oversight and tracking of highly capable AI systems\nThe first step in achieving a productive framework for safe AI development is an open dialogue among the many stakeholders involved, which includes everyone. We must rise above the hyper-politicized discourse that our dishonest and broken media often forces upon us. This topic is too important and the ramifications are too profound.

Indeed, Werther is often considered to be the \"spark\" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first \"best-seller\".

In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared Faust Part One (1808), Elective Affinities (1809), the West-Eastern Diwan (an 1819 collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of Hafez), his autobiographical Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit (From My Life: Poetry and Truth, published between 1811 and 1833) which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his Italian Journey (1816\u201317), and a series of treatises on art.

A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community. A posthumous autobiography, on which he collaborated with Alex Haley, was published in 1965.\n\nMalcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with relatives after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison he joined the Nation of Islam (adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding \"the White slavemaster name of 'Little'\"), and after his parole in 1952 quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, and criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration. Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation's social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nIn the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca, and became known as \"el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz,\" which roughly translates to \"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\". After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences; in 2021, two of the convictions were vacated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, has persisted for decades.\n\nA controversial figure accused of preaching racism and violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated figure within African-American and Muslim American communities for his pursuit of racial justice. He was posthumously honored with Malcolm X Day, on which he is commemorated in various cities across the United States. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, while the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination, was partly redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center.", "role": "assistant"}]}

By 1910, photographs had become the magazine's trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for \"dynamical pictures\" as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image. In 1915, GHG began building the group of staff photographers and providing them with advanced tools including the latest darkroom.The magazine began to feature some pages of color photography in the early 1930s, when this technology was still in its early development. During the mid-1930s, Luis Marden (1913\u20132003), a writer and photographer for National Geographic, convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called \"miniature\" 35 mm Leica cameras loaded with Kodachrome film over bulkier cameras with heavy glass plates that required the use of tripods.In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs. National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of National Geographic are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles. The standard for photography has remained high over the subsequent decades and the magazine is still illustrated with some of the highest-quality photojournalism in the world.

{"messages": [{"content": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\n\nGiven these paragraphs about Large language models, when was the first model in OpenAI's GPT series trained?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "2018.", "role": "assistant"}]}

More traditional summer bull-runs are held in other places such as towns and villages across Spain and Portugal, in some cities in Mexico, and in the Occitan (Camargue) region of southern France.

However, there would be a significant negative economic impact because dirigibles fly much more slowly than airplanes, thus the items airplanes carry (e.g. people and freight) would take much longer to get to their destination.

The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.\n\nBonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nThe most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation.", "role": "assistant"}]}

{"messages": [{"content": "Mao Zedong[a] (26 December 1893 \u2013 9 September 1976), also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary who was the founder of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which he led as the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party from the establishment of the PRC in 1949 until his death in 1976. Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist, his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism.\n\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in Shaoshan, Hunan. He supported Chinese nationalism and had an anti-imperialist outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. He later adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at Peking University as a librarian and became a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land reform policies, and ultimately became head of the CCP during the Long March. Although the CCP temporarily allied with the KMT under the Second United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), China's civil war resumed after Japan's surrender, and Mao's forces defeated the Nationalist government, which withdrew to Taiwan in 1949.\n\nOn 1 October 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the PRC, a Marxist\u2013Leninist single-party state controlled by the CCP. In the following years he solidified his control through the Chinese Land Reform against landlords, the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, the \"Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns\", and through a truce in the Korean War, which altogether resulted in the deaths of several million Chinese. From 1953 to 1958, Mao played an important role in enforcing command economy in China, constructing the first Constitution of the PRC, launching the industrialisation program, and initiating military projects such as the \"Two Bombs, One Satellite\" project and Project 523. His foreign policies during this time were dominated by the Sino-Soviet split which drove a wedge between China and the Soviet Union. In 1955, Mao launched the Sufan movement, and in 1957 he launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign, in which at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals and dissidents, were persecuted. In 1958, he launched the Great Leap Forward that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from agrarian to industrial, which led to the deadliest famine in history and the deaths of 15\u201355 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the Socialist Education Movement, and in 1966 he initiated the Cultural Revolution, a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of Mao's cult of personality. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During the Mao era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its family planning policy.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century, Mao remains a controversial figure within and outside China. Beyond politics, Mao is also known as a theorist, military strategist, and poet. Mao has been credited with transforming China from a semi-colony to a leading world power, with greatly advanced literacy, women's rights, basic healthcare, primary education and life expectancy. However, Mao's government was responsible for vast numbers of deaths, with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions. During his leadership tenure, China was heavily involved with other Asian communist conflicts such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cambodian Civil War.\n\nGiven this text of Mao Zedong, tell me how many people were killed in Mao's era through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Mao's government was responsible for vast numbers of deaths, with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions.", "role": "assistant"}]}

It began when the United States declared war on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by Congress on 17 February 1815.\n\nTensions originated in long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Native American tribes who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Northwest Territory. These escalated in 1807 after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and press-ganged men they claimed as British subjects, even those with American citizenship certificates. Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against.[d] News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway.\nAt sea, the far larger Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 to 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada. This was balanced by the US winning control of the Northwest Territory with victories at Lake Erie and the Thames in 1813. The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy. In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war.\n\nIn August 1814, British troops burned Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. Fighting continued in the Southeastern United States, where in late 1813 a civil war had broken out between a Creek faction supported by Spanish and British traders and those backed by the U.S. Supported by U.S. militia under General Andrew Jackson, the U.S.-backed Creeks won a series of victories, culminating in the capture of Pensacola in November 1814. In early 1815, Jackson defeated a British attack on New Orleans, catapulting him to national celebrity and later victory in the 1828 United States presidential election. News of this success arrived in Washington at the same time as that of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which essentially restored the position to that prevailing before the war. While Britain insisted this included lands belonging to their Native American allies prior to 1811, as Congress did not recognize them as independent nations, the Americans did not comply with these provisions and the British made no effort to compel them to do so. The Native Americans were subsequently pushed west of the Mississippi River.", "role": "assistant"}]}

When she turned the corner in the cave, she saw the most beautiful sparkling dragon and could not believe her eyes! She slowly crept toward the dragon, who was watching her closely as she approached. She held out her hand as if to pet the dragon and the dragon sniffed her hand, then rubbed it's head on the bottom of her hand to signal that it wanted to befriend her. She giggled as the dragon purred and rubbed it's shiny body circling around her. The dragon then spoke and asked her if she had ever been to the beyond worlds. The girl shook her head, the dragon blinked her eyes and projected an image onto the cave wall to show one of the beautiful beyond worlds that was filled with dragons. The girl asked if the dragon would take her there, the dragon laughed and nodded, signaling for the girl to jump on it's back. The rush of excitement came over the girl, and she hopped on the dragons back. She held on tight as the dragon started running out of the cave, as the dragon exited the cave a portal opened and it leaped into the portal. The girl closed her eyes, not knowing what would happen next, she finally opened her eyes and gawked with amazement when they arrived in the beyond world, she could not believe what she was seeing, DRAGONS!

As such, athletes are not allowed to receive assistance from anyone else outside the race, with the exception of race-sanctioned aid volunteers who distribute food and water on the course.\n\n\nTransition area (bicycles) of Hamburg Triathlon, 2002\nTriathlons are timed in five sequential sections:\n\nfrom the start of the swim to the beginning of the first transition (swim time);\nfrom the beginning of the first transition to the end of the first transition (T1 time);\nfrom the start of the cycling to the end of the cycling leg (cycling time);\nfrom the beginning of the second transition to the end of the second transition (T2 time);\nfinally from the start of the run to the end of the run, at which time the triathlon is completed.\nResults are usually posted on official websites and will show for each triathlete his/her swim time; cycle time (with transitions included); run time; and total time. Some races also post transition times separately.\n\nOther rules of triathlon vary from race to race and generally involve descriptions of allowable equipment (for example, wetsuits are allowed in USAT events in the swimming stage of some races when the water temperature is below 25.6 \u00b0C (78.1 \u00b0F)), and prohibitions against interference between athletes. Additionally, the use of flippers or other swim propulsion and flotation aids are illegal in triathlon and can result in disqualification.\n\nOne rule involving the cycle leg is that the competitor's helmet must be donned before the competitor mounts (or even takes possession of, in certain jurisdictions) the bike, and it must remain on until the competitor has dismounted; the competitor may not be required to wear the helmet when not on the bicycle (e.g. while repairing a mechanical problem). Failure to comply with this rule will result in disqualification. Additionally, while on the bike course, all bicycles shall be propelled only by human force and human power. Other than pushing a bicycle, any propulsive action brought on by use of the hands is prohibited. Should a competitor's bike malfunction they can proceed with the race as long as they are doing so with their bicycle in tow. There are also strict rules regarding the 'bike mount' line. Competitors may not begin riding their bicycle out of transition until they are over a clearly marked line. Mounting the bike prior to this may incur a penalty (example: a 15-second time penalty at the London 2012 Olympics was imposed on Jonathan Brownlee, a competitor from Great Britain, for mounting his bike too early.)\n\nOther time penalties can be incurred during the race for, among other things, drafting on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nExtract the basic universal competition sections of the triathlon in order, and explain each section.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Triathlons are timed in five sequential sections.\nFrom the start of the swim to the beginning of the first transition (swim time).

Preheat the stove to medium heat and warm the pot or pan while you do this. Then pour the eggs into the pan and continually stir the eggs, scraping the bottom of the pan to ensure the eggs are fluffy. You can also poach an egg by cracking an egg into boiling water.

{"messages": [{"content": "The English rock band the Beatles are commonly regarded as the foremost and most influential band in popular music history. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they sparked the \"Beatlemania\" phenomenon in 1963, gained international superstardom in 1964, and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society's developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the era's youth and counterculture, British identity, popular music's evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented following.\n\nMany cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to national prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British Invasion) and inspired many young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the group had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks, and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks. In 1965, they were awarded MBEs, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were \"more popular than Jesus now\".\n\nThe Beatles often incorporated classical elements, traditional pop forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, especially with the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the album to become the dominant form of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. The band also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, psychedelia, progressive rock and heavy metal. By the end of the decade, the group were seen as an embodiment of the era's sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song \"All You Need Is Love\".\n\nOver the 1960s as a whole, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and continue to enjoy a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of \"Yesterday\" exceeding thousands. As of 2009, they were the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide.

Nike gained this honored role beside Zeus during the Titanomachy where she was one of the first gods to offer her allegiance to Zeus. At Athens, Nike became a servant to Athena as well as an attribute of her due to the prominent status Athena held in her patron city.

Oftentimes, people purchase chickens at local feed stores, or through a hatchery.\n\nCreating a brooder - Chickens not being raised by a mother hen need assistance from their owner to survive. Chickens are raised in a brooder, which can look like a variety of things. Many individuals create their own brooder out of cardboard, plastic or wood. Different sources identify a variety of different square feet per bird needed, but a rule of thumb can be two square feet per chicken. This number can be lowered when the chick is young, but as they grow they will need at least two square feet per bird. It is important that chicken owners place their brooder in a draft-free place, yet still allow holes in the brooder for ventilation.[citation needed]\n\nHeating and bedding - Chicks require a warm environment. In a brooder, this warm environment is created artificially with a heat lamp. My Pet Chicken recommends a red heat lamp, because a white heat lamp can create a harsh and uncomfortable environment for the baby chicks. During the first week of the chicks' life, a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit is required. The temperature can be decreased by 5 degrees F. each week of the chicks life, until they reach week 6. At week 6, the birds should have enough feathers grown to be moved into their chicken coop. Checking on chicks often is important, as chicks that are too cold will huddle together to attempt to retain warmth, and chicks that are too hot will spread out in the brooder in attempts to cool down. Temperature can be adjusted accordingly by lowering and raising the heat lamp in the chick's brooder. Temperature can also be monitored by the use of a thermometer.[citation needed] Wooden chips are often used in the bottom of the brooder as a bedding.\n\nFood and water - Chicks require different food than adult chickens. Chicks need a mash or dust food so that they are able to digest it without grit. Adult chickens are able to digest grit, which allows them to eat bigger food pellets. Purchasing chick food from a local feed store that is specifically for baby chicks will ensure that all nutritional requirements are being met. There are different types of food for different types of chicks. Chicks that are grown for egg-laying purposes require a lower protein level than chicks that are grown as a source of meat.

This means that the first place on any visualisation that a person from any of these cultures will look is top left. Consequently, the content you put in the top left space of your dashboard should be a critically important part of the story you are trying to tell. In a culture that writes right to left you might put higher-value content on the right-hand side of the visualisation. \n\nIn terms of in terms interpretation you want to key into things that people are naturally good at interpreting. For example, if you are presenting sales by product category and you have 10 product categories you could choose to leverage a bar chart where the length of the bar represents sales or a pie chart where the angle of the slice represents sales. A bar chart would be a better choice because people find it easy to compare the length of a bar. We cannot distinguish between the sizes of a slice with anywhere near the same level of accuracy.

The Journal of Personality published a special issue on defence mechanisms (1998).\n\nIn the first definitive book on defence mechanisms, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936), Anna Freud enumerated the ten defence mechanisms that appear in the works of her father, Sigmund Freud: repression, regression, reaction formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning against one's own person, reversal into the opposite, and sublimation or displacement.\n\nSigmund Freud posited that defence mechanisms work by distorting id impulses into acceptable forms, or by unconscious or conscious blockage of these impulses. Anna Freud considered defense mechanisms as intellectual and motor automatisms of various degrees of complexity, that arose in the process of involuntary and voluntary learning.\n\nAnna Freud introduced the concept of signal anxiety; she stated that it was \"not directly a conflicted instinctual tension but a signal occurring in the ego of an anticipated instinctual tension\". The signalling function of anxiety was thus seen as crucial, and biologically adapted to warn the organism of danger or a threat to its equilibrium. The anxiety is felt as an increase in bodily or mental tension, and the signal that the organism receives in this way allows for the possibility of taking defensive action regarding the perceived danger.\n\nBoth Freuds studied defence mechanisms, but Anna spent more of her time and research on five main mechanisms: repression, regression, projection, reaction formation, and sublimation. All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social situation.\n\nRepression: when a feeling is hidden and forced from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable\nRegression: falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as \"less demanding and safer\"\nProjection: possessing a feeling that is deemed as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or \"unconscious urge\" is seen in the actions of other people\nReaction formation: acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, \"often exaggerated and obsessive\". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to \u2013 rather than cheat \u2013 become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.\nSublimation: seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways\nOtto F. Kernberg (1967) developed a theory of borderline personality organization of which one consequence may be borderline personality disorder. His theory is based on ego psychological object relations theory. Borderline personality organization develops when the child cannot integrate helpful and harmful mental objects together. Kernberg views the use of primitive defence mechanisms as central to this personality organization. Primitive psychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and they are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and projective identification are seen as borderline defences.\n\nIn George Eman Vaillant's (1977) categorization, defences form a continuum related to their psychoanalytical developmental level.[non-primary source needed] They are classified into pathological, immature, neurotic and \"mature\" defences.\n\nRobert Plutchik's (1979) theory views defences as derivatives of basic emotions, which in turn relate to particular diagnostic structures. According to his theory, reaction formation relates to joy (and manic features), denial relates to acceptance (and histrionic features), repression to fear (and passivity), regression to surprise (and borderline traits), compensation to sadness (and depression), projection to disgust (and paranoia), displacement to anger (and hostility) and intellectualization to anticipation (and obsessionality).\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) published by the American Psychiatric Association (1994) includes a tentative diagnostic axis for defence mechanisms. This classification is largely based on Vaillant's hierarchical view of defences, but has some modifications. Examples include: denial, fantasy, rationalization, regression, isolation, projection, and displacement.\n\nWhat are the defense mechanisms?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "There are multiple definitions of defense mechanism based on different theories.

{"messages": [{"content": "Breathing apparatus\nMain article: Scuba set\n\nRecreational diver putting on his scuba set before diving\nThe defining equipment used by a scuba diver is the eponymous scuba, the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which allows the diver to breathe while diving, and is transported by the diver. It is also commonly referred to as the scuba set.\n\nAs one descends, in addition to the normal atmospheric pressure at the surface, the water exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure of approximately 1 bar (14.7 pounds per square inch) for every 10 m (33 feet) of depth. The pressure of the inhaled breath must balance the surrounding or ambient pressure to allow controlled inflation of the lungs. It becomes virtually impossible to breathe air at normal atmospheric pressure through a tube below three feet under the water.\n\nMost recreational scuba diving is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece to supply the breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers are more likely to use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.\n\nOpen-circuit\nMain article: Diving regulator\n\nAqualung Legend second stage (demand valve) regulator\n\nAqualung first stage regulator\n\nGekko dive computer with attached pressure gauge and compass\n\nSuunto submersible pressure gauge display\nOpen circuit scuba has no provision for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration. The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase the buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small lifting bag. The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.\n\nThe most commonly used scuba set uses a \"single-hose\" open circuit 2-stage demand regulator, connected to a single back-mounted high-pressure gas cylinder, with the first stage connected to the cylinder valve and the second stage at the mouthpiece. This arrangement differs from \u00c9mile Gagnan's and Jacques Cousteau's original 1942 \"twin-hose\" design, known as the Aqua-lung, in which the cylinder pressure was reduced to ambient pressure in one or two stages which were all in the housing mounted to the cylinder valve or manifold. The \"single-hose\" system has significant advantages over the original system for most applications.\n\nIn the \"single-hose\" two-stage design, the first stage regulator reduces the cylinder pressure of up to about 300 bars (4,400 psi) to an intermediate pressure (IP) of about 8 to 10 bars (120 to 150 psi) above ambient pressure. The second stage demand valve regulator, supplied by a low-pressure hose from the first stage, delivers the breathing gas at ambient pressure to the diver's mouth. The exhaled gases are exhausted directly to the environment as waste through a non-return valve on the second stage housing. The first stage typically has at least one outlet port delivering gas at full tank pressure which is connected to the diver's submersible pressure gauge or dive computer, to show how much breathing gas remains in the cylinder.\n\nRebreather\n\nAn Inspiration electronic fully closed circuit rebreather\nMain article: Diving rebreather\nLess common are closed circuit (CCR) and semi-closed (SCR) rebreathers which, unlike open-circuit sets that vent off all exhaled gases, process all or part of each exhaled breath for re-use by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver. Rebreathers release few or no gas bubbles into the water, and use much less stored gas volume, for an equivalent depth and time because exhaled oxygen is recovered; this has advantages for research, military, photography, and other applications. Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open-circuit scuba, and special training and correct maintenance are required for them to be safely used, due to the larger variety of potential failure modes.\n\nIn a closed-circuit rebreather the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather is controlled, so it can be maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial pressure in the breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen at any time during the dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real-time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems. Because rebreathers produce very few bubbles, they do not disturb marine life or make a diver's presence known at the surface; this is useful for underwater photography, and for covert work.\n\nWhat are the primary breathing apparatuses for scuba", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The most common breathing apparatus for Scuba Diving is an open circuit single hose 2-stage demand regulator connected to a single gas cylinder.

{"messages": [{"content": "Operation Aurora was a series of cyber attacks conducted by advanced persistent threats such as the Elderwood Group based in Beijing, China, with ties to the People's Liberation Army. First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.\n\nThe attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted. According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical were also among the targets.\n\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices. Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.\n\nThe attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.\n\nAccording to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways\u2014much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"\n\nHistory\n\nFlowers left outside Google China's headquarters after its announcement it might leave the country\nOn January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had been attacked; other sources have since cited that more than 34 organizations were targeted. As a result of the attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China. On the same day, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the attacks and requesting a response from China.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News reported that the United States Congress plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.\n\nIn Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \"illegal flower tribute\". The Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous official stated that China was seeking more information on Google's intentions.\n\nAttackers involved\nFurther information: Cyberwarfare by China\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists. Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.\n\nThe \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.\n\nElderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company \u2013 a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.\n\nAttack analysis\nIn its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\". However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.\n\nSecurity experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack. Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue, and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September. Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.\n\nVeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".\n\nAccording to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"\n\nOnce a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\n\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.\n\nResponse and aftermath\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.\n\nIn an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.\n\nThe Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"\n\nSecurity company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week.[clarification needed] \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19. According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.\n\nResearchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8\u2014even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on.[dubious \u2013 discuss] According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"\n\nMicrosoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September. Work on an update was prioritized and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities. They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\n\nSecurity researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School. As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China. Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.\n\nIn March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.\n\nGoogle retrospective\nOn October 3, 2022, Google on YouTube released a six-episode series covering the events that occurred during Operation Aurora, with commentary from insiders who dealt with the attack, though the series primary focus was to reassure the Google-using public that measures are in place to counter hacking attempts.\n\nGiven this article about Operation Aurora, which companies were targeted in the attacks?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Google, Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical appear to have been targted in these attacks.

The term covers the organism's morphology (physical form and structure), its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code (its genotype) and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting the phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorphic. A well-documented example of polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown. Richard Dawkins in 1978 and then again in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as caddisfly larva cases and beaver dams as \"extended phenotypes\".\n\nWilhelm Johannsen proposed the genotype\u2013phenotype distinction in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's hereditary material and what that hereditary material produces. The distinction resembles that proposed by August Weismann (1834\u20131914), who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic cells (the body). More recently, in The Selfish Gene (1976), Dawkins distinguished these concepts as replicators and vehicles.\n\nThe genotype\u2013phenotype distinction should not be confused with Francis Crick's central dogma of molecular biology, a statement about the directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to protein, and not the reverse.", "role": "assistant"}]}

These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution. Say's definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word \"wealth\" for \"goods and services\" meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed, because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity, which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science.\" Citing Robbins: \"Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses\". After discussing it for decades, Robbins' definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and it has opened way into current textbooks. Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins' definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition. Due to the lack of strong consensus, and that production, distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics, the old definition still stands in many quarters.\n\nFrom the passage provided, extract the names and published work of the early economists.

{"messages": [{"content": "A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).\n\nLike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.\n\nTransformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain and are increasingly becoming the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n\nThe paper \"Attention is all you need\" proposed the Transformer model for the first time, which had a profound impact on the subsequent LLM.

Using Self-Attention solves the problem of limited labeled data in NLP. The sequence information in the input text is preserved through Positional Encoding.

The legend goes back to the fabled battle of Kurukshetra fought between the five Pandava brothers and their cousins, the 100 Kaurava brothers, which is the pivot of the Mahabharata. Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.\n\nA folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slayed their cousins \u2014 the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Br\u0101hmanahatya (killing of Brahmins \u2014 the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.\n\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (\u201chidden Kashi\u201d \u2014 the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Doleshwor Mahadeva Temple, Bhaktapur district Nepal.\n\nA variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas. After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[citation needed]. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.\n\nAfter completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.\n\nResearch and findings\nThe Hindu activist Bharat Jangam had been researching and claiming that Doleshwar Mahadev is the head part of Kedarnath based on the surprising links between Kedarnath and Doleshwor. The Sculptures of Shive found in both shrines are 4,000 years old. Even a stone scripture found in Doleshwor was written in Sanskrit and Old Nepalese. The priests in both shrines are selected from India's southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both priests affix the word \u2018ling\u2019 after their names to convey their proximity to the god as his worshipper and both temples have a cluster of five Shiva shrines. The main deity of both priests is Birbhadra, a companion of Shiva, according to Hindu scriptures. \n\nRecognition\nOn August 22, 2009 the head priest of Kedarnath peeth Shree 1008 Jagat Guru Bheemashankarling Shivacharya unveiled the plaque claiming that Doleswore Mahadev, located in Jangam math Bhaktapur, is the head part of Shri Kedarnath.
